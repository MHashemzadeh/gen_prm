Question: How many even natural-number factors does $n = 2^2 \\cdot X \\cdot 7^2$ have? If we know that the answer is 12, what is the value of unknown variable X?
Correct solution: Every factor of $n$ is in the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot7^c$ for $0\\le a\\le2$, $0\\le b\\le1$, and $0\\le c\\le2$. To count the number of even factors, we must restrict the power of 2 to be at least 1: $1\\le a\\le2$. This gives us a total of $(2)(1+1)(2+1)=\\boxed{12}$ even factors.
Proposed solution:
Step 1: The given information states that n has 12 even natural-number factors.
Step 2: We can set up the equation as follows:
Number of even natural-number factors = 12.
Step 3: To find the value of x, we need to consider the prime factorization of n.
Step 4: The prime factorization of n is 2^2 * x * 7^2.
Step 5: The even natural-number factors of n are determined by the exponents of the even prime factors in the prime factorization.
Step 6: In this case, the even prime factors are 2 and 7.
Step 7: The exponents of 2 are 2, 1, and 0 (2^2, 2^1, and 2^0).
Step 8: The exponents of 7 are 2, 1, and 0 (7^2, 7^1, and 7^0).
Step 9: Therefore, the value of x is 2.
Step 10: The value of x is 2. The answer is 2.
Analysis:
Step 1: States that the given information states that n has 12 even natural-number factors. Correct? Yes.
Step 2: Sets up the equation to find the value of x. Correct? Yes.
Step 3: Considers the prime factorization of n to determine the exponents of the even prime factors. Correct? Yes.
Step 4: The number of even natural-number factors is indeed determined by the exponents of the even prime factors (specifically the exponent of 2) in the prime factorization. Correct? Yes.
Step 5: Calculates the value of x based on the exponents of the even prime factors. Correct? Yes.
Step 6: Only 2 is an even prime factor. The number 7 is an odd prime and does not contribute to the "evenness" of the factors. Correct? No.
The remaining steps are incorrect as they are based on an incorrect step.

Question: Sixteen is 64$\\%$ of what number?
Correct solution: If the number is $x$, we can set up the equation $\\frac{16}{x}=\\frac{64}{100}$. We divide both sides by $4$ to get $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{4}{100}=\\frac{1}{25}$, so $x=\\boxed{25}$.
Proposed solution:
Step 1: The equation \\( \\frac{64}{100} \\cdot x = 16 \\) represents the relationship that sixteen is 64\\% of the unknown number \\( x \\). Correct? Yes.
Step 2: Identifies \\( x \\) as the unknown number that we need to find, which is correct. Correct? Yes.
Step 3: The simplification of \\( \\frac{64}{100} \\) should result in \\( \\frac{16}{25} \\), not \\( \\frac{8}{25} \\). Therefore, the equation should be \\( \\frac{16}{25} \\cdot x = 16 \\). Correct? No.
The remaining steps are incorrect as they are based on an incorrect step.

Question: Find the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.
Correct solution: The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.
Proposed Solution:
Step 1: To find the domain of the expression \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}} \\), we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined and the denominator is not zero.
Step 2: For the numerator \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\) to be defined, \\( x - 2 \\geq 0 \\), so \\( x \\geq 2 \\).
Step 3: For the denominator \\( \\sqrt{5-x} \\) to be defined, \\( 5 - x \\geq 0 \\), so \\( x \\leq 5 \\).
Step 4: Combining these two conditions, the domain is \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( x \\leq 5 \\), so \\( 2 \\leq x \\leq 5 \\).
Step 5: Therefore, the domain of the expression is \\( [2,5] \\). The answer is [2,5].
Analysis:
Step 1: This step identifies that both the numerator and denominator must be defined and that the denominator cannot be zero to determine the domain of the expression. Correct? Yes.
Step 2: The condition \\( x - 2 \\geq 0 \\) ensures that the numerator \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\) is defined. Correct? Yes.
Step 3: The condition \\( 5 - x \\geq 0 \\) ensures that the denominator \\( \\sqrt{5-x} \\) is defined and non-zero. Correct? Yes.
Step 4: Combining the conditions \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( x \\leq 5 \\) is partially correct as it fails to account for the fact that \\( x = 5 \\) makes the denominator zero, which is undefined. The correct combination should exclude \\( x = 5 \\), resulting in \\( 2 \\leq x < 5 \\). Correct? No.
The remaining steps are incorrect as they are based on an incorrect step.

Question: Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?
Correct solution: If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight. If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight. Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$: 
\\begin{align*}
30n&=480\\\\
\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}
\\end{align*}
The answer is $16$.

The answer is $16$.
Proposed solution:
Step 1: Determine the total weight Terrell lifts with the two 20-pound weights.
Step 2: Calculates the total weight lifted per lift: \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) pounds.
Step 3: Calculates the number of lifts needed with the two 15-pound weights by dividing the total weight by 15: \\(480 \\div 15 = 32\\).
Step 4: Therefore, Terrell must lift the two 15-pound weights \\(32\\) times to lift the same total weight. The answer is 16.

Question: If the system of equations\\n\\n\\begin{align*}\\n6x-4y&=a,\\\\\\n6y-9x &=b.\\n\\end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.
Correct solution: If we multiply the first equation by $-\\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\\n\\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$\\nSince we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have\\n\\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\\\\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$ The answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$
Proposed solution:
Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate the coefficient of \\( y \\):
\\[
2(6x - 4y) = 2a \\implies 12x - 8y = 2a.
\\]
Step 2: Add the two equations:
\\[
(12x - 8y) + (6y - 9x) = 2a + b \\implies 3x - 2y = 2a + b.
\\]
Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):
\\[
3x = 2y + 2a + b \\implies x = \\frac{2y + 2a + b}{3}.
\\]
Step 4: Substitute \\( x \\) back into the first equation:
\\[
6\\left(\\frac{2y + 2a + b}{3}\\right) - 4y = a \\implies 4y + 4a + 2b - 4y = a \\implies 4a + 2b = a.
\\]
Step 5: Solve for \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\):
\\[
4a + 2b = a \\implies 3a = -2b \\implies \\frac{a}{b} = -\\frac{2}{3}.
    \\]
Step 6: Therefore, \\( \\frac{a}{b} = -\\frac{2}{3} \\). The answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$.
Analysis:
Step 1: Multiplying the first equation by 2 is a valid algebraic operation aimed at aligning the coefficients for potential elimination of a variable. Correct? Yes.
Step 2: Adds the transformed first equation to the second equation. The arithmetic is accurate. Correct? Yes. 
Step 3: Solves for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\). The algebraic manipulation maintains the integrity of the equation. Correct? Yes.

Step 5: Solves for \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\). The algebraic steps are accurate and lead to the correct ratio. Correct? Yes.
Step 6: The final conclusion presents the value of \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) based on the previous steps. Correct? Yes.

Question: Ryan has 3 red lava lamps and 3 blue lava lamps. He arranges them in a row on a shelf randomly, then turns 3 random lamps on. What is the probability that the leftmost lamp on the shelf is red, and the leftmost lamp which is turned on is also red?
Correct solution: There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for Ryan to arrange the lamps, and $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for him to choose which lamps are on, giving $20\\cdot20=400$ total possible outcomes. There are three cases for the leftmost lamp on the shelf: either it is red and on, it is red and off, or it is blue. If it is red and on, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are on, and $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are red. This gives $10\\cdot10=100$ possibilities. If it is red and off, there are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose which lamps are on, and since both the leftmost lamp and the leftmost lit lamp must be red, there are $\\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways to choose which other lamp is red. This case gives 40 valid possibilities, for a total of 140 valid arrangements out of 400. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{140}{400}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{20}}$. The answer is $\\frac{7}{20}$.
Proposed solution:
Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the 6 lava lamps (3 red and 3 blue):
\\[
\\binom{6}{3} = 20.
\\]
Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 lamps to turn on:
\\[
\\binom{6}{3} = 20.
\\]
Step 3: Determine the number of arrangements where the leftmost lamp is red:
\\[
\\text{Number of arrangements with leftmost lamp red} = \\binom{5}{2} = 10.
\\]
Step 4: Among these arrangements, calculate the number of ways to choose 3 lamps to turn on such that the leftmost turned-on lamp is also red. Since the leftmost lamp is red, it must be one of the lamps turned on:
\\[
\\text{Number of ways} = \\binom{5}{2} = 10.
\\]
Step 5: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:
\\[
\\text{Probability} = \\frac{10 \\times 10}{20 \\times 20} = \\frac{100}{400} = \\frac{1}{4}.
\\]
Step 6: Therefore, the probability that the leftmost lamp on the shelf is red and the leftmost turned-on lamp is also red is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).
Analysis:
Step 1: The total number of ways to arrange 3 red and 3 blue lava lamps in a row is calculated using combinations. Correct? Yes.
Step 2: The total number of ways to choose 3 lamps to turn on out of 6 is calculated. Correct? Yes.
Step 3: The number of arrangements where the leftmost lamp is red is calculated by fixing the first lamp as red and arranging the remaining 2 red lamps among the remaining 5 positions. Correct? Yes.
Step 4: Given that the leftmost lamp is red and must be turned on to satisfy that it is the leftmost turned-on lamp, the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 lamps to turn on from the remaining 5 is calculated. Correct? Yes.
Step 5: The probability is calculated as \\( \\frac{10 \\times 10}{20 \\times 20} = \\frac{100}{400} = \\frac{1}{4} \\). However, the correct number of favorable outcomes should account for the dependency between the arrangement and the selection of lamps to turn on. Specifically, not all combinations where the leftmost lamp is red and turned on are independent of the arrangements. The correct number of favorable outcomes is 140, leading to a probability of \\( \\frac{7}{20} \\), not \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). Correct? No.
The remaining steps are incorrect as they are based on an incorrect step.
