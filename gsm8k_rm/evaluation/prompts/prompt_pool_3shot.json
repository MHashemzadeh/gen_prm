        "Question: Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school. Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?\nStep 1: Ken poured jelly beans into the box until the weight was 2 pounds, so the weight of the box was 2 pounds at first.\nStep 2: Then Ken added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple, so the weight of the box was 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.\nStep 3: After Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, the weight of the box was 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.\nStep 4: Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again, so the weight of the box was 8 * 2 = 16 pounds. The answer is 16.",
        "Question: Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?\nStep 1: Alexis spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt, so she spent 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = $143 on everything else.\nStep 2: Alexis had a budget of $200 and finally there was $16 left, so she spent 200 - 16 = $184 in total.\nStep 3: Since Alexis has spent $143 on everything else, she spent 184 - 143 = $41 on the shoes. The answer is 41.",
        "Question: Tina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nStep 1: Tina makes $18.00 an hour, so she makes 18 * 8 = $144.00 in an 8-hour shift.\nStep 2: Tina works 10 hours every day for 5 days, so she works 10 * 5 = 50 hours.\nStep 3: Since she works 8 hours every day, she gets 50 - 8 * 5 = 10 hours of overtime.\nStep 4: Her hourly overtime wage is 18 + 18 / 2 = $27.00.\nStep 5: Tina works 10 hours a day, and 8 hours of that is paid at her regular hourly wage, so she makes 10 - 8 = 2 hours of overtime every day.\nStep 6: Since her hourly overtime wage is $27.00, she makes 27 * 2 = $54.00 in overtime each day.\nStep 7: Every day, tina makes $144.00 in an 8-hour shift and $54.00 in overtime, so she makes 144 + 54 = $198.00 each day.\nStep 8: Tina works 5 days a week, so she makes 198 * 5 = $990.00. The answer is 990."
