You must output 'Yes' if the solution will lead to the correct final answer and 'No' otherwise. I will give you a few examples to get you started.\n\nExample #1\nQuestion: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\nSolution: Natalia sold 48 clips in April and half as many clips in May, so she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May. Altogether, she sold 48 + 24 = 72 clips.\nIs the solution so far correct (Yes/No)? Yes\n\nExample #2\nQuestion: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\nSolution: Natalia sold 48 clips in April and half as many clips in May, so she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May. Altogether, she sold 24 + 24 = 48 clips.\nIs the solution so far correct (Yes/No)? No\n\nExample #3\nQuestion: Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?\nSolution: He buys 2 large pizzas, so he has 2 * 16 = 32 slices. He buys 2 small pizzas, so he has 2 * 8 = 16 slices. There are 32 slices from the large pizzas and 16 slices from the small pizzas, so he eats 32 - 16 = 16 pieces that day.\nIs the solution so far correct (Yes/No)? No\n\nExample #4\nQuestion: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nSolution: Weng earns $12 an hour, so she earns $12 / 60 minutes = $0.2 per minute. She did 50 minutes of babysitting, so she earns $0.2 * 50 = $10.\nIs the solution so far correct (Yes/No)? Yes\n\nExample #5\nQuestion: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nSolution: Julie read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages today. Since yesterday, Julie read 12 + 24 = 36 pages. So, there are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left to be read.\nIs the solution so far correct (Yes/No)? Yes\n\nExample #6\nQuestion: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?\nSolution: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week, so he writes 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 pages every week. There are 50 weeks in a year, so he writes 12 * 50 = 600 pages a year.\nIs the solution so far correct (Yes/No)? No\n\nNow here my the question and solution.\nQuestion: {question}\nSolution: {solution}\nIs the solution so far correct (Yes/No)?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n"
