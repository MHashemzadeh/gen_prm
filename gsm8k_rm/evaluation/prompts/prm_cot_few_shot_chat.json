You must determine whether the calculations so far are part of a complete correct solution. The final answer may not be reached yet. What matters is whether the steps provided are a part of a complete correct solution. Provide an analysis first, then indicate with 'Yes' or 'No' whether it is correct. I will give you a few examples.\n\nExample 1\nQuestion: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\nNatalia sold 48 clips in April and half as many clips in May, so she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May. Altogether, she sold 48 + 24 = 72 clips.\nAnalysis: The solution so far calculates the number of clips sold in May (24) and sums the clips sold in April (48) and May (24) to get the total (72).\nCorrect so far? Yes\n\nExample 2\nQuestion: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\nStep 1: Natalia sold 48 clips in April and half as many clips in May, so she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May.\nStep 2: Altogether, she sold 24 + 24 = 48 clips.\nAnalysis: Step 1 calculates the number of clips sold in May (24). Step 2 makes an error in the final sum. It should be 48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips, not 24 + 24 = 48.\nCorrect so far? No\n\nExample 3\nQuestion: Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?\nStep 1: He buys 2 large pizzas, so he has 2 * 16 = 32 slices.\nStep 2: He buys 2 small pizzas, so he has 2 * 8 = 16 slices.\nStep 3: There are 32 slices from the large pizzas and 16 slices from the small pizzas, so he eats 32 - 16 = 16 pieces that day.\nAnalysis: Steps 1 and 2 calculate the number of slices for large and small pizzas. Step 3 makes an error in the final calculation. It should add the slices (32 + 16 = 48) instead of subtracting them (32 - 16 = 16).\nCorrect so far? No\n\nExample 4\nQuestion: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nStep 1: Weng earns $12 an hour, so she earns $12 / 60 minutes = $0.2 per minute.\nStep 2: She did 50 minutes of babysitting, so she earns $0.2 * 50 = $10.\nAnalysis: The solution so far calculates Weng's per-minute rate ($0.2) and then multiplies this by the number of minutes worked (50) to get the total earnings ($10).\nCorrect so far? Yes\n\nExample 5\nQuestion: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nStep 1: Julie read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages today.\nStep 2: Since yesterday, Julie read 12 + 24 = 36 pages.\nStep 3: So, there are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left to be read.\nAnalysis: The solution so far calculates the pages read today (24), the total pages read so far (36), and the remaining pages (84). All calculations are correct.\nCorrect so far? Yes\n\nExample 6\nQuestion: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?\nStep 1: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week, so he writes 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 pages every week.\nStep 2: There are 50 weeks in a year, so he writes 12 * 50 = 600 pages a year.\nAnalysis: Step 1 calculates the pages written per week (12). Step 2 makes an error in assuming there are only 50 weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the final calculation is incorrect.\nCorrect so far? No\n\nNow, given the question: {question}\n{solution}\nAnalyze the solution so far and provide an analysis. After the analysis, determine whether the steps in solution will lead to the correct final answer. The final answer may not be reached yet. What matters is whether the steps provided are a part of a complete correct solution. Output Yes or No, nothing else. If you are unsure provide your best guess.<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n"
