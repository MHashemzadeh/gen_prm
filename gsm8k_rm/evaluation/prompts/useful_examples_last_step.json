He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?\nStep 1: He buys 2 large pizzas, so he has 2 * 16 = 32 slices.\nStep 2: He buys 2 small pizzas, so he has 2 * 8 = 16 slices.\nStep 3: There are 32 slices from the large pizzas and 16 slices from the small pizzas, so he eats 32 - 16 = 16 pieces that day.\nIs the last step correct?
